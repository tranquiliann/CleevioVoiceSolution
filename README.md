# Cleevio Voice Solution

This repository contains a snapshot of the [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents) `llamaindex-rag` example. The agent has been modified to display itself as **LLMADEX** and use the "ash" voice when speaking.

See `llamaindex-rag/README.md` for usage instructions.
